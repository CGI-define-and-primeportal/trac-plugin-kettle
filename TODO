== For running BIRT reports ==

Macro to run a report/chart inline

Add "Run" option to the Browser context menu for report files

Add 'download as' menu to report viewing page

Add paging

Add PDF export option (currently claims class not found for the exporter?)

Fix Pentaho reports (might need some Java coding to avoid having MasterReport in python-space)

Add report selection feature

Add report uploading

Store reports into ${env.path}/reports ?

Add ticket_bi_current VIEW for sqlite ?

== For the FLOT charts ==

Extend TicketQuery macro (replacing 'table' with 'chart' and aggregating the
first col ?)

AJAX load the chart on the query page?

Consider doing the summing in the database, although not sure how much
faster that would actually be - we still need to get the list of
tickets via Python (to run the Trac permission system on each ticket),
and we'd still need to cast the strings into floats...
